# Mech Shooter Game

A 3D mech-based shooter game built with [Ogre3D](https://www.ogre3d.org/) engine. This project was originally created as a university assignment approximately 10 years ago and is now being modernized to work with current technologies.

## About Ogre3D

OGRE (Object-Oriented Graphics Rendering Engine) is an open-source 3D graphics rendering engine that has been actively developed since 2001. It's a scene-oriented, flexible engine written in C++ that abstracts the details of 3D graphics APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D. Ogre3D has been used in various commercial games, simulators, educational software, and visualization tools.

## Project History

This game was originally developed around 2013-2014 as a university project. The initial version was built using:
- Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows
- Ogre3D SDK (version 1.x or 2.x)
- OIS for input handling

## Current Modernization Effort

I'm currently working on bringing this project back to life with modern tools and making it cross-platform. This modernization effort stems from my passion for fixing and reviving old software. Unable to find a suitable project to showcase my skills, I decided this old university assignment would be a perfect challenge to demonstrate my abilities while satisfying my love for bringing abandoned code back to life:

- Migrating from Visual Studio to CMake-based build system
- Updating from Ogre3D 1.x/2.x to Ogre3D 14.x
- Making it run on Linux (specifically Manjaro/Arch) with potential Windows compatibility
- Adapting to API changes between old and new Ogre versions
